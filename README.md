# Finding Perfect pth power
An integer X is a "perfect square power" if there is some integer Y such that Y2 = X. An integer X is a "perfect cube power" if there is some integer Y such that Y3 = X. We can extrapolate this where P is the power in question: an integer X is a "perfect p'th power" if there is some integer Y such that YP = X.

This program in C finds the highest value of P for a given X such that for some unknown integer Y, YP should equal X.
